> # My First Rust Compression Project
>
> ## Overview
>
> This is my first attempt at a Rust project, and it's a program that demonstrates file compression using the flate2 crate. The goal is to compress a source file and write the compressed data to a target file.
>
> ## Usage
>
> 1. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
>
> 2. Clone the repository:
>
>    ```bash
>    git clone https://github.com/nanditha48/rust-compression-project.git
>    ```
>
> 3. Navigate to the project directory:
>
>    ```bash
>    cd rust-compression-project
>    ```
>
> 4. Build the project:
>
>    ```bash
>    cargo build
>    ```
>
> 5. Run the project:
>
>    ```bash
>    cargo run source_file.txt target_file.gz
>    ```
>
>    Replace `source_file.txt` with the path to the file you want to compress and `target_file.gz` with the desired name for the compressed file.
>
> ## Project Structure
>
> - `src/main.rs`: The main Rust source file containing the compression logic.
> - `Cargo.toml`: The project configuration file for Cargo.
>
> ## Dependencies
>
> - [flate2](https://crates.io/crates/flate2): A Rust crate for working with compressed files.
>
> ## Learning Experience
>
> This is my first experience with Rust, and I'm excited to explore its unique features and learn more about systems programming.
