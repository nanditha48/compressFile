# My First Rust Compression Project

## Overview

This is my first attempt at a Rust project, and it's a program that demonstrates file compression using the flate2 crate. The goal is to compress a source file and write the compressed data to a target file.


## Project Structure

src/main.rs: The main Rust source file containing the compression logic.
Cargo.toml: The project configuration file for Cargo.

## Dependencies

flate2: A Rust crate for working with compressed files.
